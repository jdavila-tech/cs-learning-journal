## Workflow Example

**Typical steps to create a shared group directory:**
1. Add user: `sudo useradd username`
2. Set/expire password: `passwd username`, `passwd -e username`
3. Create group: `groupadd groupname`
4. Add user to group: `usermod -aG groupname username`
5. Create directory: `mkdir /shared`
6. Change group ownership: `chown :groupname /shared`
7. Set permissions: `chmod g+rw /shared`

## Fun Fact

Did you know?  
The `tree` command is not always installed by default on Linux, but it's a favorite for visualizing directory structuresâ€”just run `sudo apt install tree` on Ubuntu to get it.
