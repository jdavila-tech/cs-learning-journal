#Module 1
# Introduction to Scripting

This is a summary of core concepts from my scripting class, written in Python.

---

## Basic Output with print()

- Use `print()` to display text.
- Text must be inside quotes: `'Hello'` or `"Hello"`.
- Each `print()` ends with a new line by default.
- Use `end=' '` to keep output on the same line.

Example:
```python
print('Hello', end=' ')
print('World')  # Output: Hello World
```

---

## Printing Multiple Items

- Use commas to separate items in a `print()` call.
- Commas automatically insert spaces between items.

Example:
```python
print('Age:', 25)
```

---

## Newline Characters

- Use `\n` to move to the next line within one string.

Example:
```python
print('Line1\nLine2\nLine3')
```

---

## Reading Input

- Use `input()` to get text from the user.
- All input is returned as a string.

Example:
```python
name = input('Enter your name: ')
```

---

## Converting Input Types

- Use `int()` to convert a numeric string to an integer.

Example:
```python
age = int(input('Enter your age: '))
```

## Common Error Types

| Error Type        | Description                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| SyntaxError       | Code is not valid Python syntax                   |
| IndentationError  | Code is not indented properly                     |
| ValueError        | Invalid value (e.g., trying to convert 'abc' to int) |
| NameError         | Using a variable that hasn't been defined         |
| TypeError         | Using incompatible types (e.g., 'Hello' + 5)      |

---

## Runtime Errors

- Code runs, but crashes during execution.
- Examples:
  - Dividing by zero
  - Converting bad input to int
  - Invalid operations (e.g., 'Hi' * 'Bye')

---

## Logic Errors

- Program runs but gives wrong result.
- Often caused by wrong formulas or typos.

Example:
```python
total = 2 * 4  # Should have been 2 * 40
```

---

## Why Whitespace Matters

- Output must exactly match expected spacing and formatting.
- Spaces and line breaks affect grading and output comparison.

---

## Programming = Precision

- Small mistakes break programs:
  - `=` vs `==`
  - `i < 10` vs `i <= 10`
  - Not checking for zero before dividing
- Always double-check details and test often.
